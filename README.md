Physics Simulation Course Code

This repository contains the code I developed for my Physics Simulation course. It includes simulations and projects on topics such as fractal physics, numerical integration, 
solving differential equations, Monte Carlo simulations, and moreâ€¦
It also contains a final project on cell separation.

All code is written for educational purposes as part of course assignments and projects.
